# CPUThrottle
This program/application is to create CPU chaos for resiliency testing validation. Detailed documentation will be provided shortly. 
Running the program(.class) or jar - will prompt you for the CPUs number of host. If you give all the CPUs available(say n) on the host, it will create a 100% CPU usage on the host. If you give n/2 number at the prompt, this program will create a 50% usage.
